## Distributions of Model Accuracy
	
	Every time we run the classification model, we get a different accuracy. This occurs because every time we run the program, the training and testing set are randomly assigned different sets of data. After 1000 trials for the Breast Cancer data, the average accuracy is 96.94%. The standard deviation of the accuracies is 1.23.
